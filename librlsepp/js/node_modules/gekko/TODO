get fork patched into mainstream
split config files off to local repo

one config one codebase one install script
  private / public mix

with github and npm, the install directions utilize npm for the exchanges
i can use a package.json and a post install script to simply copy the files around

create stubs for many more exchanges
  perhaps draw from ccxt (also javascript)
